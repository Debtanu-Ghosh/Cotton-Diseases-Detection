# Cotton Diseases Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Cotton is a crucial crop in global agriculture, but it is highly vulnerable to various diseases that impact yield and quality. This project employs deep learning with transfer learning to develop an automated cotton disease detection system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

We evaluated three deep learning architectures:

- MobileNetV2 â€“ Lightweight model optimized for real-time applications.
- ResNet152V2 â€“ Deep residual network that prevents vanishing gradients.
- InceptionV3 â€“ Efficient model with parallel convolutions for improved feature extraction.
The system classifies cotton leaf images into healthy or diseased categories, improving early disease detection and facilitating timely intervention.
